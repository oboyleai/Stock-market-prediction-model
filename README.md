Python-based machine learning model leveraging the RandomForestClassifier from Sci-kit learn to predict
daily stock price movements of the SP 500 index, using historical data retrieved via the yfinance library.
• Engineered robust features incorporating rolling averages and trend data across multiple horizons utilizing the Pandas
library for data manipulation, to capture short-term fluctuations and long-term market trends.
• Implemented a comprehensive backtesting framework using a rolling window approach for progressive model training and
model validation, while employing precision scoring and thresholding techniques on predicted probabilities for fine-tuned
binary classification accuracy.
